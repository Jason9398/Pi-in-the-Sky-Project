# Pi-in-the-Sky-Project
## Planning
We plan on making a water rocket.The things we will be mesuring are altatuide and rotation.Another thing that needs to be done is write a code for both the acelromiter and the altimiter and make the rocket. 
### Matirals needed 
Two liter soda botle launch pad previded by will,cardboard for fins,cloth from umbrella to make a perasuit.wires,breadbord,tape,siscers,hot glue,air presure gun we used when we used the air cannon,altimeter,acelatomiter 
### Bill of matirals 
2 soda bottles
1 altimiter
1 acelromiter
4 pices of cardborad
launch pad privideded by will
cloth from an unbrella
wires
breadbord
tape
siscers
hot glue
air presure gun
water
red led
green led
### Diagram
initate code to check that everything is working
