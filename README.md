# Pi-in-the-Sky-Project
## Planning
We plan on making a water rocket.The things we will be measuring are altituide and rotation.Another thing that needs to be done is write a code for both the acelromiter and the altimiter and make the rocket. 
### Matirals needed 
Two liter soda botle launch pad provided by will,cardboard for fins,cloth from umbrella to make a parachute.wires,breadbord,tape,siscers,hot glue,air presure gun we used when we used the air cannon,altimeter,acelatomiter

### what I need to learn
I need to learn how to make a code for the altimiter and the acelromiter.

### definition of succes
my definition of succes is that it works and we get an A on the project.
### saftey mesures
wearing gogles and other saftey equitment
### schedule/what we did to day.
#### 12/6
Finished up the planing and submitted it.

#### 12/12
Have gathered all the matirals and already got work




#### January 
We should be finding code that we could use to measure our rocket's rotation and altitude.

#### February  

we should have an prototype made and ready to go.

#### March 

We should have our final tweaks and design done and ready for test day...

#### April

Launch and data collection

#### May 

We will be analyzing our collected data and making our last bit of documentation.


#### June 

We should be done with everything.
