# Pi-in-the-Sky-Project
## Planning
We plan on making a water rocket.The things we will be measuring are altituide and rotation.Another thing that needs to be done is write a code for both the acelromiter and the altimiter and make the rocket. 
### Materials needed 
Two liter soda botle launch pad provided by will,cardboard for fins,cloth from umbrella to make a parachute.wires,breadbord,tape,siscers,hot glue,air presure gun we used when we used the air cannon,altimeter,acelatomiter
### Sketch of water rocket

### Bill of materials 
2 soda bottles

1 altimiter

1 acelromiter

4 pieces of cardborad

launch pad provideded by will

cloth from an umbrella

wires

 2breadbord

tape
1scissors

hot glue

air presure gun

water

1Green led

1Red led
### diagram
initate code to check that everything is working

if not red led glows and oled reads error

if so countdown stars an oled screen counts down from 10-0 and 

at 0 green led glows and it says lifftoff on the screen

### what I need to learn
I need to learn how to make a code for the altimiter and the acelromiter.

### definition of succes
my definition of succes is that it works and we get an A on the project.
### saftey measures
wearing gogles and other saftey equipment
### schedule/what we did to day.
#### 12/6
Finished up the planing and submitted it.

#### 12/12
Have gathered all the matirals and already got work




#### January 
We should be finding code that we could use to measure our rocket's rotation and altitude.

#### February

we should have an prototype made and ready to go.

#### March 

We should have our final tweaks and design done and ready for test day...

#### April

Launch and data collection

#### May 

We will be analyzing our collected data and making our last bit of documentation.


#### June 

We should be done with everything.
