# Pi-in-the-Sky-Project
## Planning
We plan on making a water rocket.The things we will be mesuring are altatuide and rotation.Another thing that needs to be done is write a code for both the acelromiter and the altimiter and make the rocket. 
### Matirals needed 
Two liter soda botle launch pad previded by will,cardboard for fins,cloth from umbrella to make a perasuit.wires,breadbord,tape,siscers,hot glue,air presure gun we used when we used the air cannon,altimeter,acelatomiter 
### Bill of matirals 
2 soda bottles
1 altimiter
1 acelromiter
4 pices of cardborad
launch pad privideded by will
cloth from an unbrella
wires
breadbord
tape
siscers
hot glue
air presure gun
water

### what I need to learn
I need to learn how to make a code for the altimiter and the acelromiter.

### definition of succes
my definition of succes is that it works and we get an A on the project.
### saftey mesures
wearing gogles and other saftey equitment
### schedule/what we did to day.
#### 12/6
Finished up the planing and submitted it.

#### 12/12
Have gathered all the matirals and already got work




The start of January 

We should be finding code that we could use to measure our rocket's rotation and altitude.

By February 

we should have an prototype made and ready to go.

By March 

We should have our final tweaks and design done and ready for test day...

April 

Launch and data collection

May
