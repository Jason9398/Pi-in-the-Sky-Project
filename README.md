# Pi-in-the-Sky-Project
## Planning
We plan on making a water rocket.The things we will be measuring are altituide and rotation.Another thing that needs to be done is write a code for both the acelromiter and the altimiter and make the rocket. 
### Materials needed 
Two liter soda botle launch pad provided by will,cardboard for fins,cloth from umbrella to make a parachute.wires,breadbord,tape,siscers,hot glue,air presure gun we used when we used the air cannon,altimeter,acelatomiter
### Sketch of water rocket

### Bill of materials 
2 soda bottles

1 altimiter

1 acelromiter

4 pieces of cardborad

launch pad provideded by will

cloth from an umbrella

wires

 2breadbord

tape
1scissors

hot glue

air presure gun

water

1Green led

1Red led
### diagram
initate code to check that everything is working

if not red led glows and oled reads error

if so countdown stars an oled screen counts down from 10-0 and 

at 0 green led glows and it says lifftoff on the screen

### what I need to learn
I need to learn how to make a code for the altimiter and the acelromiter.

### definition of succes
my definition of succes is that it works and we get an A on the project.
### saftey measures
wearing gogles and other saftey equipment
### schedule/what we did to day.
#### 12/6
Finished up the planing and submitted it.

#### 12/12
Have gathered all the matirals and already got work




#### January 
We should be finding code that we could use to measure our rocket's rotation and altitude.

#### February

we should have an prototype made and ready to go.

#### March 

We should have our final tweaks and design done and ready for test day...

#### April

Launch and data collection. We did launch a prototype but did not have the code ready in order to get any data.

#### May 

We will be analyzing our collected data and making our last bit of documentation.
Code is about done. Working on remaking our parachute. Its been three days and we're having an difficult time with the parachute. Hopefully as of today May 12 we finish the parachute. Did not finish the parachute on the 12th , still in progress of making an sucessful one, May 15th. As of right now our main focus is to add some finishing touches to our code and again the parachute and we'll be done, hopefully by the 20th. As of today may 23rd , we are finishing soldering our wires bread board and accelerometer and altimeter together. We are also attempting to remake the parachute.

#### June 

We should be done with everything. By this time we should have gathered every bit of data we've collected and be finished with the whole project.

### All together
this is what they look like all together

### pin Map
Here is my pin map showing how my curkit board is wired it is realy hard to make sure you get the wires in the right spot
